- a GET request that queries the DB by officeId and returns the office info

## Migrations

Migrations are handled using sequelize. After a successful deployment a migration script is triggered by executing the following command:
`sls migrations up --host=<host> --stage=<stage>`

The host URL is fetched by querying the cloudformation Output for the RDSHost.
